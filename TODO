Things to be done:

 * CALCTYPE: Change calculation type (done, rev.30)
 * CALC: Alter calculation (Calc, Geom, CType) 
 * CALC: Start calculation job (submit to PBS)
 * CALC: Restart calculation job (make sure that UseSaveData is set to True)
 * GEOM: Read from ANI (multiple, done rev.125), OUT (multiple, done?), SPH
   -> May be even integrate binary RHO file?
 
 * CALC: Analyze calculation
   -> RDF (done)
   -> MSD (done), Diffusion quot
   -> Voronoi (integrate in the suite)
    -- May be Cython? Or pure C or Fortran?
   -> W6 quot?
   -> Spins? 
     -- distribution around C atoms 
   
 * Use MPL or Chaco to draw graphs (Mayavi for Voronoi? (done))
   -> MDE (done, rev.32)
   -> RDF (partial?)
   -> Diffusion (type-wise)
